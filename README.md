# Assignment 2 - Reverse a file with JavaScript

Change the source file ``lib/assignment.js``, such that the unit tests
succeed.  __Do__ __not__ __use__ any standard library classes in your
solution!
Don't change any other files! Use the command ``npm install && npm test``
to run the tests.  You are done when the command displays:

        test
        ✔ test reverse
        ✔ test reverse more examples

        OK: 2 assertions (10ms)

Now commit your changes and generate a patch:

        git format-patch origin/master
